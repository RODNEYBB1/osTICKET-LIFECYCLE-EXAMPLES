<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

IN THIS INSTANCE AN END USER/CUSTOMER HAS REPORTED AN ISSUE. THE CUSTOMER WILL LOGIN TO THE HELP DESK PORTAL AND CREATE AN TICKET. USER WILL HAVE TO ENTER CONTACT INFO AND HELP TOPIC AS TO WHAT IS GOIN ON. FROM THAT POINT THE USER WILL  HAVE TO REPORT THE ISSUE AS BEST AS THEY CAN WITH AS MUCH INFO THAT IS MOST HELPFUL THEN THEY WILL CREATE THE TICKET.

NOW WE LOGIN AS HELP DESK AGENT ON THE OTHER PORTAL WE WILL OBSERVE THE TICKET'S PROPERTIES BY PRIORTIY/DEPARTMENT/SLA AND WHO ITS ASSIGNED TO. FROM THE TICKETS WE NAVIGATE TO OPEN THE TICKETS, NAVIGATE TO PRIORITY AND ALSO THE SLA PLAN, TAKE A GLANCE AT THE COMMENTS AND DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY OF THE COMMENTS THE USER INPUT, POSSIBILTY YOU MAY WANT REACH OUT THE CUSTOMER TO ACTUALLY GAUGE THE ISSUE.

ONCE YOU REACH OUT TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE PRIORITY OR SLA PLAN NEED TO CHANGE DUE TO THE IMPORTANCE , CHANGE THEM TO THE RESPECTIVE SELECTION TO ROUTE THE ISSUE APPROPRIATELY.

WHEN RESOLVING TICKETS, ITS IMPORTANT TO HAVE STRONG COMMUNICATION. ONE HAS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR TEAM AND THE AFFECTED USERS. TICKETS COME AND GO WITH THE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND DESIGNED APPROPRIATELY TO DIFFERENT PEOPL. DOCUMENTATION IS CRUCIAL TO A SUCCESSFUL ENVIROMENT. TICKETS NEED TO BE DOCUMENTED PROPERLY DO THRY CAN BE USED AS REFERENCE IF A SIMILAR ISSUE SHOWS UP IN THE FUTURE.

THE PROTOCOLS FOR HOW TICKETS ARE MANAGED CAN DIFFER DEPENDING ON WORK ENVIRONMENT. THERE MAYBE A QUOTA FOR HOW MANY TICKETS NEED TO BE RESOLVED WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME FRAME AND CERTAIN TICKETS WILL HAVE TO BE PRIOROTIZED DEPEDNING ON THE SITUATION. I HAVE BUILT osTICKET FROM SCRATCH AND WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TICKETS WORK IN AN (IT) POSITION.
